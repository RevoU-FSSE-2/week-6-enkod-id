# How to download docker in windows
> "Docker" is a software platform that allows you to develop, test, and run applications in an isolated environment called "containers." In this context, "containers" refer to standardized software units that package all the elements needed by software, including code, runtime, libraries, and other dependencies. This enables applications to run consistently in various environments, both on development computers and in production environments
